# ðŸŒ¿ Verde - TypeScript Refactor

[Original project](https://github.com/RFP-Verde/RFP-2204-FEC) - Verde is a fictional ecommerce site that was developed as part of my bootcamp's Front End Capstone group project.

In the original project, I was responsible for designing the Overview component of the page. Shortly after finishing the project with my group, I decided that this would be a great opportunity for me to learn a new skill.
